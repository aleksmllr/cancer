# cancer

Playing around with a gene expression dataset from individuals with two different types of cancer. Main goal is to train a classifier to distinguish between the two classes of cancer. This dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes.
